MACL: Multi-Label Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
This repository contains the implementation of MACL (Multi-Label Adaptive Contrastive Learning) — a contrastive loss designed for multi-label remote sensing image retrieval (ML-RSIR).
MACL addresses challenges such as semantic overlap, class imbalance, and complex label co-occurrence by adaptively weighting sample pairs and dynamically scaling similarity temperatures.

The method consistently improves retrieval quality across benchmark datasets — including DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD — without adding significant computational overhead.
